# Metronome Trainer Privacy Policy

The extension does not collect any user data.
The only sensitive piece of information is a Notion Integration secret
which is saved to the browser's storage using the Chrome Storage Sync API
and is used solely as an access token for Notion Public API.
This way, none of your Notion information leaves the browser and Notion boundaries.

Regardless of this privacy guarantees it is recommended to connect the Notions Integration
only to pages that are intended to be used with the extension.
